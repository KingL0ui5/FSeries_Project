1.1: 
    Fixed - Issues with calling the functions. FSeries was contained within the epic_fourier.epic_fourier structre before, however now calling epic_fourier.series should be sufficient. 
    
    Added - Better exception handling for input parameters to FSeries.

1.2.1:
    Fixed - Issue with np.array not having property to_ndarray() just a silly error :)

Note: Huge thank you to Temmuz for testing my code first and reporting the main errors to me
